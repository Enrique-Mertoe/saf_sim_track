SIM Card Management System Documentation
System Overview
The SIM Card Management System is a web-based application designed to track SIM card sales by various teams and match them against Safaricom activation reports. The system helps distributors monitor which sold SIM cards have been activated, their top-up status, and generates performance reports for team evaluation.
Business Context
The system is designed for Safaricom distributors who need to track SIM card sales across multiple sales teams. Teams record SIM cards they've sold, then later match these against official Safaricom reports to determine activation status and quality metrics. Each team has a leader responsible for onboarding new staff and monitoring their performance. The application tracks quality metrics and generates periodic reports.
Key Workflow
SIM Card Recording: Teams record serial numbers of SIM cards they've sold
Report Upload: Admin/Team Leaders upload Safaricom reports containing activation data
Matching Process: System matches recorded SIM serials against the report data
Performance Tracking: System identifies "matched" SIMs (sold and activated) and "quality" SIMs (activated with top-up ≥ 50 KES)
Reporting: System generates performance reports by team based on match rates and quality metrics

Data Processing Logic
Matching Logic
A SIM card is considered "Matched" when:
Its serial number exists in both the system's recorded SIMs and the Safaricom report
Quality Determination Logic
A SIM card is considered "Quality" when:
It has been matched (exists in Safaricom report)
A top-up has been performed
The top-up amount is at least 50 KES
No fraud flags are present
Performance Calculation
Team match rate is calculated as:
Match Rate % = (Matched SIMs / Total Recorded SIMs) * 100
Team quality rate is calculated as:
Quality Rate % = (Quality SIMs / Matched SIMs) * 100
Performance Rating Logic
Team performance comments are determined as:
≥ 95%: "Well done"
≥ 90% and < 95%: "Improve"
< 90%: "Needs immediate attention"

Conclusion
This SIM Card Management System provides a comprehensive solution for recording and tracking SIM card sales across different teams. The system allows for matching recorded SIMs against Safaricom reports to determine activation status and quality metrics, with robust reporting capabilities to support business decision-making.
The primary workflow involves recording SIM serials, uploading Safaricom reports, matching the data, and generating performance metrics - all designed to help distributors track team performance and ensure quality activations.
